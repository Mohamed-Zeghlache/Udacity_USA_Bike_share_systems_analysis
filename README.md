# Udacity_USA_Bike_share_systems_analysis
In this project, i will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. i will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics.

# Steps
i made use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States.

i have performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and have written code to compute descriptive statistics.

i have compared the relative volume of trips made between three U.S. cities and the ratio of trips made by Subscribers and Customers. For one of these cities, i have investigated differences between Subscribers and Customers in terms of how long a typical trip lasts.

# Conclusion
according to my analysis : 
the ridership is lowest in January, February and December (winter) , and it's highest in June, July and August (summer)
the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips does not change depending on the month or season, they both go up toghether or go down toghether, only in the winter where the ratio of customers drops down a lot according to the suscribers .
